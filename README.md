# DriveCRM-
HSR Motors’ sales team struggled with scattered leads, missed follow-ups, poor prioritization, and limited insights. I built DriveCRM: a smart system with lead scoring, automation, collaboration tools, and AI-driven insights. It cuts manual work 60%, speeds responses 40%, boosts conversions 25%, and streamlines sales.
1. Smart Lead Tools
o	Scores leads (1–100) so you focus on the best ones.
o	Detects “hot leads” showing strong interest.
o	Sends auto follow-ups & reminders so no lead is missed.
o	Auto-assigns top leads to best sales reps.
2. Lead & Pipeline Management
o	One place to view and filter all leads.
o	Colored tags (New, Contacted, Qualified) for quick updates.
o	Full customer history with notes, emails & test drives.
3. Dashboard Insights
o	Shows live stats like total leads & conversion rate.
o	Pie charts show which sources (Website, Ads, etc.) work best.
o	Gives tips, alerts & performance insights.
4. Teamwork & Speed
o	Share notes and comments with team members.
o	Bulk actions to assign or update many leads at once.
